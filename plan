Stacksteps:
        Desegnate A as the source, B as the second free rod and C as the destination

Stacksteps 2 = A->B, A->C, B->C
Stacksteps 3 = A->B, (desegnate C as free rod and stack)

Note: Consider any swaps involved when desegnatinf B and C

Record whether stacking X involves a switch?
It may not be necessary to obstruct destination layers.

Stack:
        If at top level:
                Move largest on source onto a free rod
        Else:
                You can actually swap places each go
                You actually have to as there will only be one free rod
        Treat the source as a free rod.

Memory for 1 =
        Move to C
Memory for n =
        Expose upper layer at free rod !!! FREE ROD CHANGES WITH EACH RECURSION
        Move to C
        Move from free rod to C
